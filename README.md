# 543-Final-Project

In this project, we implement Fast Gradient Sign Method and Projected Gradient Descent with the goal of perturbing images to cause misclassification. We incorporate our novel objective function aimed at minimizing the perturbation and maximizing misclassification rates, and run our algorithms on 16 images from the ImageNet dataset.
