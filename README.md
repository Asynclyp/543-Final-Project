# 543-Final-Project

In this project, we implement Fast Gradient Sign Method and Projected Gradient Descent with the goal of perturbing images to cause misclassification. We incorporate our novel objective function aimed at minimizing the perturbation and maximizing misclassification rates, and run our algorithms on 16 images from the ImageNet dataset.

# How To Use
Suggested IDE: Pycharm
Python version 3.10+
Packages: TensorFlow, Matplotlib, Numpy, Scikit-Optimize

There three python files each corresponds to the implementation of FGSM, PDG with Bayesian Optimization, and PDG with Hill Climbing Optimization. Running each python program would generates the results detailed in our report.
